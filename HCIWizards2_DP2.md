## DP1 Summary
At DP1, we engaged on making target users and experience to redesign. According to our target user, we interviewed three potential users with various environments. Thus, we could find some needs and interesting insights. 

Target user : minors who are using credit card borrowed by parents for online consumption activities

Experience to redesign : The inconvenient and time-consuming process of getting permission from their parents for online consumption

#### Key Needs 
* They are eager for a fast and real-time method to request and get permission from their parents.(time sale,emergent purchases,etc)
* They need realtime spending notification (expressed shock at their spending total)
* They wanted independence from physical presence of parents

#### Key Insights 
* When using a parent's card, they are uncomfortable with payment details being shared in real time.
* Minors not only buy cheap things online, but also consume some expensive things, where they need to be supervised by their parents
* Developing a more streamlined parental approval process using digital means could significantly enhance convenience


## POV
Minors who engage in online consumption activities needs a convenient way to get permission from their parents because contacting parents for getting permission is time-consuming and many consumptions do not initially necessitate such process.

## Persona

## How Might We Quesion
 
* HMW figure out if it is unnecessary or necessary payment?
* HMW make the minors payment to be done immediately?
* **HMW get permission from parents for payment even when they have difficulty to check the messenger?**
* **HMW enable minors to set pre-approved limit with their parents and manage their spendings within it?**
* **HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission?** 
* HMW prevent the risk of theft or leakage of parent's card information?
* HMW reduce the permission process without prohibiting open communication between minors and parents?
* HMW balance parental oversight with the minor's autonomy in making purchasing decisions?
* HMW change the personal settings depends on minor’s age, consumption tendency, or ability?
* HMW create a safe authentication method that allows parents to give permission to minors?

## Top 3 HMW Questions

We voted for the good HMWs that each group member thought were good, discussed the HMWs that received the most votes, and ultimately selected three HMWs. We considered whether it states the problems in POV, whether it states the issues that are likely to occur in the actual implementation process, and whether we could solve it.

1. HMW get permission from parents for payment even when they have difficulty to check the messenger?

Reason for selection: As mentioned at POV, contacting parents to get permission is time-consuming. One of the reasons for this situation is that parents could not check the messenger always. That's why we chose this HMW to find a solution to this.

2. HMW enable minors to manage their spending within pre-approved limits set by their parents?

Reason for selection: The experience we want to redesign is to change the existing permission process, which was overly dependent on parents, to one that imposes more autonomy on minors. However, this change can make minors overspend or buy dangerous items. Therefore, we chose this HMW to reduce this risk.

3. HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission?

Reason for selection: One other problem with the current permission process is minors have to get permission for every purchase. Food delivery or low-cost items are not areas that necessarily require parent’s permission. So, we choose this HMW to make some proper categories to skip the permission.

## Solution 1

Solution for first HMW question: HMW get permission from parents for payment even when they have difficulty to check the messenger?

* Make auto-permission system using machine learning that judge instead of parents when they are not available
* Leverage voice recognition technology to receive verbal permission from their parents
* Links with other peripheral devices to enable quick acceptance
* Save the parents' card information in the minor's mobile app, and payment can be made using this app by minor
* Allow minors to tag immediacy of each request
* Allow minors to proceed to the last step of the payment before receiving parental permission, and that payments are completed right after the parents approval
* Set up a scheduled time for parents to check pending requests at once
* Create a dedicated mobile application specifically designed for parents to review and approve payments.
* Allow users to designate alternate contacts, who are able to approve payments on behalf of  parents.
* **Mobile application that allows one touch approval for the request message**


## Solution 2

Solution for second HMW question: HMW enable minors to manage their spending within pre-approved limits set by their parents?

* **Create a  financial management app that allows users to manage their spending records for purchases funded by their parents.**
* Make the spending limits flexible by agreement between parents and minors
* Enable parents to temporarily adjust spending limits for special occasions like birthdays or vacations.
* Provides simple financial education that emphasizes the importance of saving to minors.
* Send alerts to minor when total spending get closer to spending limit
* Create digital wallet application designated to minors which allows spending for certain limit
* Implement system that can set limit not just on total but on each category 
* Introduce digital wallet that gives extra spending credits when minor solves quizzes related to financial literacy
* Implement an AI assistant in financial apps that helps minors make informed spending decisions within their limits.
* Develop a user-friendly dashboard that allows minors to visualize their spending habits and remaining balances within each pre-approved category.
  
## Solution 3

Solution for third HMW question: HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission?

* Utilize machine learning to predict and pre-approve the transactions based on past data
* Establish a system that only approves payments for specific stores.
* **Implement a tiered permission model that categorizes spendings by risk level, thus avoiding the need for permission for low-risk transactions.**
* Let users select some sites that allow automatic payment agreements between parents and minors.
* Allocate funds for specific stores in advance, enabling controlled spending by the child.
* Initiate regular payments for essential recurring goods(ex.sanitary items) which are usually bought by minors.
* Develop a credit relationship with store owners in relevant categories to facilitate purchases.
* Store the card information on the minor's mobile app so that it can be used by the minor. 
* Employ cards with restrictions to prevent spending in unauthorized areas. 
* Allow parents to write a whitelist for specific subscriptions or memberships.




## Top 3 Solutions
We voted for the good solutions that each group member thought were good, discussed the solutions that received the most votes, and ultimately selected three solutions. We considered whether it could be realistically implemented, whether it could integrate with existing systems or other solutions, and whether it could be a solution that directly addresses the core problems.

1. Mobile application that allows one-touch approval for the request message

Reason for selection: This solution is about creating a mobile application that revolutionizes the permission process with a one-touch approval feature. It allows minors to get immediate permission from their parents even when parents are having difficulty checking Messenger and makes simple permission steps for most requests. This can reduce the time minors have to wait for their parents’ response.

2. A financial management app that allows users to manage their spending records for purchases funded by their parents

Reason for selection: The third solution is about making a comprehensive financial management app designed specifically for minors. Traditionally, minors had limited insight into their spending patterns, as they weren't directly using their own cards or accounts. By overseeing their expenses, minors can enhance their financial literacy, manage finances themselves, foster trust from their parents, and reduce the need for constant permission.

3. Tiered permission model which categorizes spending by risk level, without requiring permission for low-risk transactions

Reason for selection: Finally we selected a tiered permission model that categorizes spending by risk level, eliminating the need for permission for low-risk transactions. This model allows for instant purchases in low-risk scenarios by eliminating the unnecessary permission process.


## Storyboards

### 1. Mobile application that allows one-touch approval for the request message

##### Story 
Our persona, June was hungry but there was nothing to eat in his house. June could not call or text his parents because they were both in work meeting. So June sent request to his parents. June's father could permit June's request during meeting by simple one-click. June could have delicious dinner and father was able to stay focused on work.

### 2. A financial management app that allows users to manage their spending records for purchases funded by their parents

##### Story 
Our persona, June ordered his dinner and new clothes using his parents' card. One day, June recieved the alert that his consumption was closing to pre-approved limit. June checked his consumption detail and decided to reduce spending for this month. As a result, June could manage his consumption wisely.

### 3. Tiered permission model which categorizes spending by risk level, without requiring permission for low-risk transactions

##### Story
Our persona, June noticed that he forgot to buy school material for today's class after his father has gone to work. Fortunately, his father had pre-approved some budget for stationary using payment app. So June could buy his needed items using the budget.

## Studio Reflection

During our studio session, we received feedback that the second HMW we had chosen seemed unrelated to the second solution. So we modified the second HMW question to fit our original intent. 

We also received feedback about the risks of simplifying the payment process in someone else's name. We were very empathetic to this feedback and closely examined how existing similar services were managing such risks.

Baedal Minjok operates a “family account” service that allows payments to be made with a family member’s card. There are procedures for the safety in the process of registering a family account. When registering, it is essential for each person to enter a password that only they share.

Additionally, many credit card companies are issuing family cards. In the process of issuing family cards, procedures are in place to prevent misuse, such as requiring documents confirming that each person is a family member.

We will actively refer to the safety procedures operated by these existing services. We will also come up with creative ideas for interfaces that will make our services more secure. These ideas will be reflected in future prototypes.
