Design Project 3: Lo-fi Prototyping 2024
=============================
## POV
Minors who engage in online consumption activities needs a convenient way to get permission for payment from their parents because contacting parents for getting permission is time-inefficient and many consumptions do not initially necessitate such process.

## Updates from DP2

Based on feedback from DP2, we made modifications to the POV, HMW, and Solution. Below are our modified POV, HMW, and Solution. The parts that have been modified are in bold.

POV: Minors who engage in online consumption activities needs a convenient way to get **permission for payment** from their parents because contacting parents for getting permission is **time-inefficient** and many consumptions do not initially necessitate such process.

HMW 1: HMW get permission from parents for payment even when they have difficulty to check the messenger?

**Solution 1: Allow users to designate alternate contacts, who are able to approve payments on behalf of parents.**

**HMW 2: HMW reduce the time-inefficient steps of authentication when minor uses parent’s card.**

**Solution 2: Rather than storing the parent's card information on the user's device, send the user's payment information to the parent's device and make the payment and authentication done on parents’ device**

HMW 3: HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission? 

**solution 3:  Make purchases within specific categories and adhere to preset budget for each category which is set by parents in advance.**

## Design Choices - What we did not implement intentionally

- Implementation that changes data: Some actions in the service we want to implement involve changes to actual data (after consumption, the corresponding consumption details are added to the history). However, we did not implement in the prototype to reflect changes in these data. This is because it requires a lot of coding, including the database, and We don't think implementing it is essential to identifying user problems.

- Sign up and log in : Low importace because it need to be done once the first time using this app.

- External shopping websites (where payment is done) : Excluded for prototype because we cannot modify them

- Details about history : Detailed payment history is replaced with a few fake ones. Not real data

- Parent’s side UI : Excluded for prototype because our target users are minors.

- Other functions which irrelevant to tasks(e.g. searching, alert, settings..)

## Observations

## Description of Participants

Participants We each recruited one participant, so we could test four participants. All of them were our target user, which is minor who use parents’ money for payment. The description of each participants are as follow: 

Pumpkin 

Pumpkin is a 17 years old girl, who is the cousin of our teammate. She gets allowance as cash from her parents, and sometimes use parents’ card to buy necessary things. She usually spends her allowance on clothes. 

Carrot 

Carrot is an 18 years old boy, who is the younger brother of a teammate's friend. He doesn’t get a periodic allowance, and usually pays with parents’ card. If he needs extra money. he asks his parents and explains where to use it. 

Cucumber 

Cucumber is a 17 years old girl, who is the younger sister of teammate’s roommate. She pays only with her allowance, which parents give to her with cash. 

Potato

Potato is a 16 years old girl, who is a friend of younger sister of one of our roommates. She both gets allowance and uses parents’ card for payment.

## Usability Problems

#### Visibility Problems
|Problems|Users|Seriousness|
|------|---|---|
|The price of the item being purchased is not visible in the payment window|P2|high|
|In the process of checking the remaining balance available for each category, the amount used so far appears on the screen and is confused with the remaining amount.|P2, P4|high|
|While checking remaining balance available for each category displayed as a bar, it is confusing whether the filled part in the bar is the remaining amount or the used amount.|P3|middle|
|The names of each category are written small and hard to see.|P1, P3, P4|middle|
|The [more+] button on the home screen is too small to be pressed.|P2, P3, P4|high|

#### Terminology Problems
|Problems|Users|Seriousness|
|------|---|---|
|Confused about what "request" and "payment" respectively mean.|P3, P4|high|
|Couldn’t understand what can be done in the category tab. Didn't know that remaining balance could be checked there.|P4|middle|
|Confused about what “view more” does in the category window. |P2|low|

#### Flow Problems
|Problems|Users|Seriousness|
|------|---|---|
|After completing the payment, the user expected to be moved to the external website where the payment was originally made, but was moved to the home screen of the Pay app|P2|middle|
|When user pressed the previous button, he expected to go to the home screen, but it immediately changed to the right before screen.|P3|low|

## Plan to address Problems

#### Solving Visibility Problem

plan : Change font, button size to be more visible (ex. increase “more+” button size in home screen, notice that the filled part of bar is used amount in bar of category page, etc.) 

expected effect : our service will be more intuitive to use.

#### Solving Terminology Problem

plan : Change terminology to help users to understand functionality(“view more” in category window -> delete button, change some word “request” to “payment request”, etc.)

expected effect : users will be able to learn how to use our service more rapidly.

#### Solving Flow Problem

plan : give better, sufficient feedback about flow of our service to users (ex. when the request is done and screen is moved, notice that we are directing to home screen)

expected effect : Giving more feedback will make users less confused even if the page changes differently as they expected. 


## Studio Reflection

We got three main feedbacks in the DP3 session. The first feedback is that there is a need to specify ways for parents and children to communicate. Our app allows children to spend within an amount predetermined by parents and children. However, our prototype did not specify how to determine the predetermined amount. Therefore, we would like to support communication issues by adding a chat function. 

Children can communicate with their families about consumption through the chat function of this app. In the "Categories" tab, users can see the remaining budget for each category, and there is a "Request more budget" button to request a budget. When the user presses this button, the user will be taken to a message window, and a message requesting a budget will be automatically completed and sent.

![Reflection](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/d0bdcd26-41d2-420d-bea9-f79158f498a1)

The second feedback is that the process of users and their parents entering the service needs to be fleshed out. As it is a sensitive system that makes payments on behalf of others, it is important to identify whether the parents and children in the service are actually in a parent-child relationship. Therefore, some kind of authentication system is needed in the process of registering parents and children. Although it was not included in the presentation due to time constraints, we have already designed an authentication system, and this is briefly included in the prototype. 

The following is a description of the authentication system. Family representatives who subscribe to our service can invite their own family members. There are two ways to invite: “Invite by SNS” and “Invite by Password.” When the user clicks Invite by SNS, an invitation link can be sent to an external SNS app. Users who click the invitation link are included as family members. Invite by Password is a function used when family members are in the same space. When the representative presses the button, the password is displayed on the screen. If a family member enters the displayed password into their device, the invitation is completed.

![Plan](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/71d5312d-8c2f-4f54-8c5d-d4494b3e753f)

The last feedback indicated better defined roles and  clear agreement between different roles. We clearly defined the roles of primary and secondary approver. The primary approver is the main individual responsible for approving transactions, while secondary approvers can step in to approve transactions when the primary approver is unavailable. 
These roles are to be assigned by a family representative when first setting up the app, after a thorough discussion among family members (this will be supported by guiding text within the app to facilitate this process). 

In situations where the primary approver is busy, a minor can select one of the secondary approvers to request additional transaction approval. Typically, secondary approvers could be working parents or grandparents while primary approver could be homemaker.
