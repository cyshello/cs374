### Target Users
Minors who engage in online consumption activities

### Revised Target Users
<span style="color:#fff5b1">Minors who are using credit card borrowed by parents for online consumption activities</span>

### Experience to Redesign
The process of using parents' card for online consumption

### Revised Experience to Redesign
<span style="color:#fff5b1">The inconvenient and time-consuming process of getting permission from their parents for online consumption</span>

### Observations & Interviews

#### Revised Observation 
<span style="color:#fff5b1">Each participant showed us the process of making purchases at the online shopping mall where they make the most purchases. In a situation where parental permission was required, interviewees did not actually contact the parents, but instead informed us that they needed to contact the parents.</span>

#### Snowman: 16 years old / high school student

###### Relation with experience to redesign
<span style="color:#fff5b1">She usually uses the Kakao Mini Card and the allowance she received from her parents. However, when her pocket money runs out or she needs to buy something expensive, she contacts her parents to buy the item for her.</span>

#### Observations

![Snowman](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/b3b8130b-9049-4364-8cad-300aa4cbfe8c)

<span style="color:#fff5b1"> Snowman shows us how to make payments on Coupang because she makes a lot of payments on Coupang. The payment process was shared using Zoom's screen-sharing feature. She found a Apple airpot through a simple search on Coupang. She wouldn't make the actual purchase, she had to talk about the after process. She said she would send the link to her mother and wait for her response. </span>


#### Interesting Point 
* Korean students mainly use Kakao Mini Card for spending. 
* Kakao Mini Card is blocked on some websites 
* Feels inconvenient when splitting bills
* Want to hide some expenses from her parents (Birthday Gifts or foods)
* The process of getting permission to spend from parents is inconvenient - Reason: Difference of opinion, hard to get direct feedback


#### Spiderman: 18 years old / university student

###### Relation with experience to redesign
<span style="color:#fff5b1"> He uses both the allowance he receives from his parents and their parents' credit card. Generally, he does not ask his parents for permission, but he does ask for their permission when paying for high-value items.</span>

###### Extreme User
Unlike other minors, he was a college student living separately from his parents. Therefore, he had to do all the spending himself, rather than having his parents do it for him. He often used his parents' credit card for spending. So we selected him as an extreme user.

###### New Explanation for Extreme User
Unlike other minors, he was a college student living separately from his parents. <span style="color:#fff5b1">He had a high preference of managing the budget himself as his colleagues do. Additionally, he utilized a portion of his earnings from part-time work, enhancing his capability to manage expenditures independently. Moreover, his spending habits encompassed a wide range of categories, notably diverging from other minors, encompassing expenses related to drinks and social gatherings.</span>

#### Observations
![Spiderman](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/841b2a8d-2480-42c1-bf55-4c2715da27af)

<span style="color:#fff5b1">Spiderman said he has been buying a lot of clothes at Musinsa recently. So we asked him to show us the process of buying clothes at Musinsa. Payment was made through Toss Pay, and there was no separate process of asking parents for permission.
</span>


#### Interesting Point 
* When making a payment, minors need to get authentication from parents, which was inconvenient when parents are far away.
* Spending only 500~600 K won per month which was significantly more than average spending of minors
* Once realized that he spent too much money on his food cost where he was unable to be noticed easily
* He once had to call his parents for authentication while purchasing clothes through parent’s card at Musinsa which took a lot of time and inconvenience.
  

#### Batman: 17 years old / high school student

###### Relation with experience to redesign
<span style="color:#fff5b1"> He does not receive an allowance and makes all payments with permission from his parents. Whenever he needs to make an online payment, he contacts his parents and asks them to make the payment.</span>

#### Observation
![Batman](https://github.com/hogyulee/cs374/assets/66636839/6c5843ca-a13d-4337-858c-33d9f061f81a)

<span style="color:#fff5b1">Batman recently buys a lot of textbooks from Megastudy. So we asked him to show us the process of buying textbooks at Megastudy. He put the textbooks he wanted to buy into his shopping cart. After putting the textbooks he wanted to buy in his shopping cart, he called his parents and asked them to pay for them directly.</span>

#### Interesting Point 
* Instead of receiving allowance periodically, he request it to parents whenever he need it. 
* Tried to conceal his purchase on Naver Webtoon Cookies
* Since using a card in parents' name, he cannot check spending details. 
* Since not managing spending details, he sometimes get surprised at how much money he actually spent
* He once had to cook ramen noodle at home where he wanted to purchase dishes outside but he couldn’t receive money from his parent immediately

### Needs

* **Despite utilizing their parents’ funds, they want to check their own spending details. (Spiderman - Failed to manage food expenses)**
* **They are eager for a fast and real-time method to request and ~~receive financial support from their parents. (Batman - Ramen eating experience)~~** 
* **They are eager for a fast and real-time method to request and <span style="color:#fff5b1">get permission from their parents.(time sale,emergent purchases,etc)</span>**

* They wish that the pay service they use could be used in many places. (Snowman - Some websites banned to use Kakao mini bank)

* ~~After eating with friends, they want to split the bills in more convenient way.~~
* ~~They want to participate in various discount events without being restricted because of their age.~~ 
* ~~They want to use a pay service with a pretty interface.~~

* ~~They hope the connection between Pay and their account to be more convenient.~~
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">They want to avoid unnecessary controversy with their parents for each purchase they make.</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">They want a simplified parental permission process which allows getting permission even when they are busy.</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">They want the connection between Pay and their account to be faster and more stabilized.</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">They need realtime spending notification (expressed shock at their spending total)</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">They wanted independence from physical presence of parents</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">There’s a preference to for requesting money as needed instead of fixed periodic allowances</span>

### Insights

* **There are many payment details that minors do not want to receive permission from their parents.(Batman - Naver webtoon)**

* **~~When a minor uses a card that is not in his or her name (parent's card), the process of obtaining authentication from the website is complicated. (Spiderman - hard to purchase in Musinsa)~~**
* **~~The biggest criterion for obtaining permission when a minor uses his or her parents' money is the amount.~~** 

* ~~Minors often use mobile pay apps (Kakao Pay) instead of banking apps. (All interviewees)~~
* ~~Minors require complicated procedures to open a bank account~~ 
* ~~Some prefer to use their parents' credit card because it does not require management.~~ 
* ~~Students also incur significant expenses (100-200K won) on textbooks and food~~.
  
* When using a parent's card, they are uncomfortable with payment details being shared in real time. 
* When the mobile pay service was not supported, sending a payment link to parents was often used.

* ~~It is difficult for minors to transfer money to their account when splitting a bill~~.

* <span style="color:#fff5b1">Since getting authentication for parents’ card from the website is complicated, some of our users send link to their parents or visit their parents face to face.</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">Minors often use mobile pay apps (Kakao Pay) instead of banking apps. (All interviewee) </span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">Since all of our interviewers answered that the amount of money is the biggest criterion for obtaining permission, parents should be aware of their children’s high cost purchases.</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">Most minors do not have a bank account since it is complicated to open one, making them more dependent on their parents' card.</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">Minors not only buy cheap things online, but also consume some expensive things, where they need to be supervised by their parents</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">There is a significant opportunity to integrate technology that allows minors a degree of autonomy while still keeping parents informed and in control</span>
* <span style="color:#fff5b1">Developing a more streamlined parental approval process using digital means could significantly enhance convenience</span>



### Studio Reflections

During the studio session, we received feedback that the "online consumption" experience to redesign was **not specific enough**. So we further refined the experience to redesign. We will redesign the process of using credit/debit cards in the name of parents during online consumption. The process includes obtaining permission from parents. 

Additionally, there was feedback that our service may have **legal problems**. Since companies such as Kakao Taxi and Baedal Minjok will actually provide similar services through services such as family accounts, we do not believe there will be any legal problems. We plan to review legal guidelines in detail in the future. 

The other feedback emphasized that we shouldn’t work for the need that can’t be handled by our project. User’s need for more places where they can use Kakao mini bank wasn't an appropriate need to work on since it relates to complicated legal issues that can not be addressed by our project. On top of it, as we specified our experience to redesign specifically on using parents’ cards, it’s not even in the scope of the needs we are trying to figure out anymore. Here, we made the decision to remove this particular need from our primary focus areas to ensure we concentrate on what we can feasibly achieve.
