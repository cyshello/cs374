Design Project 5: Usability Testing
====================================
## POV
Minors who rely on parental funding for online purchases need a faster and simple way to get payment permission. A streamlined, real-time method would allow minors to make purchases easily while maintaining necessary parental oversight.

## Tasks

#### Task 1: Complete Food Delivery Payment and Check the Remaining Balance

Connected HMW: HMW allow some categories of consumption to skip the process of getting permission? 

Connected Soultion: Make purchases within specific categories and adhere to preset budget for each category which is set by parents in advance.

#### Task 2: Send Request for Permission and Payment for Clothes

Connected HMW: HMW reduce the time-inefficient steps of authentication when minor uses parent’s card?

Connected Soultion: Send a payment request directly to the parent's device, streamlining the authentication steps needed when using another person’s card.

#### Task 3: Add Another Family Member to Permission Request

Connected HMW: HMW get permission from parents for payment even when they have difficulty to check the messenger?

Connected Soultion: Allow users to add alternate contacts, who are able to approve payments on behalf of initial approver.

#### Task 4: Request Increase on Budget for Book Category

Connected HMW:
